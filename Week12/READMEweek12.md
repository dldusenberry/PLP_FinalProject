***!! PLEASE NOTE !!***

All "wxPieChart" files are not my own work. 

This is from a third party unfinished wxWidgets library Github repository.

Link to [xwCharts repo](https://github.com/wxIshiko/wxCharts/tree/main).

I am making an attempt to build on this unfinished PieChart widget for my project.

If I figure it out I will try to figure out Git pull requests and commits next!

Additionally this entire project requires the [wxWidgets library](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets) to run at all.
